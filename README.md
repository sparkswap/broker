This repo contains source for the following products:

- KCLI - CLI for Kinesis Daemon (this is in its own container OR can be used directly from `./broker-cli/bin/klci` from inside the kbd container)
- KBD - Kinesis Broker Daemon - handle interactions between LND and the Kinesis Exchange (Relayer)

### Before you begin

1. Install nvm - `brew install nvm` or your favorite package manager
2. Install the current LTS node and npm version - `nvm install --lts --latest-npm`
3. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

### The Quick n' Dirty way

```
# Create a sparkswap dir to hold your broker daemon and the engine you want to use
mkdir -p ./sparkswap

# Download the broker daemon source code
git clone git@github.com:kinesis-exchange/broker.git ./sparkswap/broker

# Download an engine's source code
git clone git@github.com:kinesis-exchange/lnd-engine.git ./sparkswap/lnd-engine

# Build the broker daemon's docker images
(cd ./sparkswap/broker && npm run build-images)

# Build your engines docker images
(cd ./sparkswap/lnd-engine && npm run build-images)

# Lets get into the broker directory to start using the code
cd ./sparkswap/broker

# Build proto files and grab information needed to start KBD
npm run build

# IMPORTANT:
# We will now need to add a valid RELAYER_RPC_HOST into the `docker-compose` file of the broker.
# This can be done by navigating to `<your_broker_directory>/docker-compose.yml` and editing
# the RELAYER_RPC_HOST under the `kbd` service
#
# Valid addresses for Relayer:
# simnet: simnet-relayer.sparkswap.com:28492
# testnet: testnet-relayer.sparkswap.com:28492
#
# For availability, please check dev.sparkswap.com
#

# Start our docker stack
docker-compose up -d

# Install depedencies for the kcli
(cd ./broker-cli/ && npm i)

# We are now ready to use kcli w/ our daemon
./broker-cli/bin/kcli wallet balance
```

If you will be developing against kbd (or any sparkswap repository), it is required to run the code through [Standard](https://standardjs.com/). StandardJS plugins can be downloaded for your favorite editor. The KBD/KCLI codebase follows StandardJS formatting.

#### Using the CLI

You can run `./broker-cli/bin/kcli -h` to view all available commands.

To set your user configuration, copy `./broker-cli/sample-.kcli.js` to `~/.kcli.js` and edit the file.
You can view default configuration for kcli in `./broker-cli/.kcli.default.js`.

Current configuration is limited to:
- Default Daemon RPC address

Additionally, you can access a specific version of kbd by setting the --rpc-address on any kcli command.

#### Running tests

- `npm test` will run all tests on your local machine
- `npm run coverage` will run tests w/ code coverage

#### Funding a wallet

....

### Authentication between Daemon and LND

TLS certs and Macaroons are shared through the `/shared` directory located at the root of the `kbd` container. The `/shared` volume is created in the lnd-engine and is shared through the broker project through the use of `-p` on the startup commands located in package.json.

The `/shared` directory will be a common pattern for all engines of the daemon.

## Product Notes

### Engines

The broker daemon (KBD) has a concept of an `Engine`. An Engine can be defined as a single implementation/multiple currency interface for all markets. An example of different engines would include LND-Engine and Eclair-Engine.

The default engine for KBD is [LND-Engine](https://github.com/kinesis-exchange/lnd-engine). This is reflected in the code and the defaults set in `docker-compose.yml`. Currently, we only support BOLT spec implementations at this time.

### Orders and Block Orders

When interacting with the Broker Daemon as a user and submitting `buy` and `sell` orders, you are creating what we refer to as "Block Orders". These block orders can have different price restrictions (limit price, market price) and time restrictions (good-til-cancelled, fill-or-kill, immediate-or-cancel).

These block orders are then "worked" by the broker, meaning split up into individual actions on the Kinesis Network. Specifically, those actions are placing new limit orders and filling other brokers' limit orders.

This structure allows the end user to submit specific desires (e.g. market price, immediate-or-cancel) without relying on the Relayer to honor it -- instead the broker is responsible for interpreting and acting on user instructions.

The overall flow looks something like this:

`buy (kcli) -> BlockOrder (kbd) -> Order (kbd) -> Order (relayer)`
