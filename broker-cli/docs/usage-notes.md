Usage Notes
===========

## Orders and Block Orders
When interacting with the Broker Daemon as a user and submitting `buy` and `sell` orders, you are creating what we refer to as "Block Orders". These block orders can have different price restrictions (limit price, market price) and time restrictions (good-til-cancelled; fill-or-kill, immediate-or-cancel are forthcoming).

These block orders are then "worked" by the broker, meaning split up into individual actions on the SparkSwap Relayer. Specifically, those actions are placing new limit orders and filling other brokers' limit orders.

This structure allows the end user to submit specific desires (e.g. market price, immediate-or-cancel) without relying on the Relayer to honor it -- instead the broker is responsible for interpreting and acting on user instructions.
