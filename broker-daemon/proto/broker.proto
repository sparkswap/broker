/**
 * This is the API definition for the Broker Daemon RPC Server.
 *
 * The Broker (or Broker Daemon) is an open source piece of software that allows anyone to
 * operate a node that keeps control of the private keys to their cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin and Litecoin)
 * and use [SparkSwap](http://sparkswap.com) to trade those currencies.
 *
 * The Broker runs as a daemon on a machine you control, and you direct it to take action through the RPC Server.
 * The Broker is responsible for translating typical trading behavior (e.g. market buys) into actions on the SparkSwap Relayer (e.g. a BTC/LTC swap on the Lightning Network).
 *
 * The Broker exposes a [gRPC service](http://grpc.io) which has support for [client libraries in many languages](https://grpc.io/about/#osp).
 *
 * The easiest way to interact with the Broker is through the [Broker CLI](https://github.com/sparkswap/broker-cli).
 *
 * For more information on the Broker, see:
 *
 *  - [Installing the BrokerDaemon](https://github.com/sparkswap/broker)
 *  - [Broker CLI](https://github.com/sparkswap/broker-cli)
 *  - [BrokerDaemon GitHub repository](https://github.com/sparkswap/broker)
 *
 * For more information on SparkSwap as a whole, see:
 *
 *  - [SparkSwap Homepage](https://sparkswap.com)
 *  - [SparkSwap Documentation](https://sparkswap.com/docs)
 *  - [SparkSwap Chat](https://sparkswap.com/chat)
 *

 *

 * // This documentation makes use of the grpc and grpc-caller libraries on npm.
 * // The remainder of the docs assumes this setup step.
 * const grpc = require('grpc')
 * const PROTO_OPTIONS = {
 *   convertFieldsToCamelCase: true,
 *   binaryAsBase64: true,
 *   longsAsStrings: true,
 *   enumsAsStrings: true
 * }
 * const brokerProto = grpc.load('/path/to/broker.proto', 'proto', PROTO_OPTIONS)
 * ```
 *
 * ```shell
 * > npm install -g https://github.com/sparkswap/broker-cli
 * > sparkswap -h
