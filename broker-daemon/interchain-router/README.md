Interchain Router
=================

The Interchain Router is a service for Lightning Network nodes (and other similar Payment Channel Network nodes) to retrieve preimages for payments sent to that node by making a payment on another Payment Channel Network.

See the [sparkswap docs](https://sparkswap.com/docs/advanced-concepts/interchain-router) for information on the design and service details.
