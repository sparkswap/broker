# External IP Addresses
#
# In order for your lightning nodes to be found by other users on the network
# you must set an external address for each chain. If you are hosting all containers
# on the same machine, then these will be the same.
#
# This address can either be a TLD or an IP address. Do NOT include the port number
# as this is defined in the docker-compose file instead.

# Docker compose files
# docker-compose by default will look for the docker-compose.yml file and apply the docker-compose.override.yml file if
# it exists. If we specify the COMPOSE_FILE variable, all compose files joined by the COMPOSE_PATH_SEPARATOR will
# be applied and used
#
COMPOSE_PATH_SEPARATOR=:
